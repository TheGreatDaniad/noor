Noor is an obfuscation-oriented tunnel designed to be used against internet censorship in Iran and other countries with restricted internet connection. 

Design goals: 

Noor is focused on obfuscation. Its purpose is to be working in the hardest situation where most of the other protocols does not work. There are also security and performance in the second place. It is meant to be flexible in case of updates in the cencorship infrastructure (a.k.a gfw) and supporting different approaches to do each of the internal functionalities so it would be resiliant in terms of different internet blocks of different regions, times, ISPs. Another design principle is simplicity and ease of use for both server providers and clients. For the clients it should work by just installing an app and clicking connect button and potentially a server address and a pass phrase. Also for the admins, it should be installed in a few minutes and least possible config, potentially zero config.
